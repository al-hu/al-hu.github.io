						<div class = "entry-description">
							One year of college, and what a whirlwind it has been!  From joining organizations and finding new friends, going through a break up, and failing a few midterms, I've definitely hit a few lows but also a few highs.  These are my reflections on my college career so far.

					<div class = "entry-title">BaseHacks: My First Hackathon</div>
						<div class = "entry-description">
							Attending a hackathon has been on my to-do list for all of freshman year, but I never really felt ready nor did I have the time.  However, I feel that my courses at Berkeley have taught me enough about programming to actually create a project this time around, and I went with some of my friends to BaseHacks.
