					<div class = "entry-title"> Looking Back on One Year of College</div>
						<div class = "entry-description">
							One year of college, and what a whirlwind it has been!  From joining organizations and finding new friends, going through a break up, and failing a few midterms, I've definitely hit a few lows but also a few highs.  These are my reflections on my college career so far.

					<div class = "entry-title">BaseHacks: My First Hackathon</div>
						<div class = "entry-description">
							Attending a hackathon has been on my to-do list for all of freshman year, but I never really felt ready nor did I have the time.  However, I feel that my courses at Berkeley have taught me enough about programming to actually create a project this time around, and I went with some of my friends to BaseHacks.

					<div class = "entry-title">Pokemon Go: My thoughts</div>
						<div class = "entry-description">
							Pokemon Go recently came out and being a huge Pokemon fan myself, I downloaded it as soon as I heard it was on the app store.  In my opinion it's pretty fun and definitely has encouraged me to get more exercise.

						<div class = "entry-description">
							I ended up only going home for a bit less than a month before going back to Berkeley for school.  Throughout the process, I learned a lot more than just CS70: I also started cooking food with friends and found an internship!

					<div class = "entry-title">Teaching Computer Science</div>
						<div class = "entry-description">
							By now, I've been teaching computer science for about eight months with the goal of eventually being a GSI in mind.  I did a bit of reflection on why I have this goal for myself and I've realized my passion for passing on knowledge.
