				It is often said that college is the most transformative period of your life, and freshman year definitely has lived up to that expectation.  Throughout the course of the year, I feel that I have learned and grown so much mentally, socially, and academically.  From days where school seemed hopeless to days that radiated happiness,  I've experienced a huge range of emotions, and this roller-coaster ride is something that I would not give for anything else in the world.

			<div class = "title">Transitioning into Independence: First Semester</div>
			<p class = "text">
				Entering Berkeley, I had no knowledge of anything with regards to computer science; I had never taken a CS course and did not know what I wanted to major in yet.  However, I listened to my parents' suggestions to take a computer science course and decided to take CS61A. I regard this as one of the most definitive life-changing decisions, not only because I found something that genuinely interests me, but also because it has taught me many valuable life lessons that I will take forward from this experience.  Being my first computer science course, I encountered many obstacles throughout the semester that I had never faced before.  In high school, I understood most topics that I was presented with, and could usually figure things I didn't understand after a few hours of studying.  However, college, especially the ideas taught in CS61A, were extremely foreign to me and I could not apply these concepts in the homework.  As a result, I spent a lot more time than I had ever spent on homework, and it was just an extremely frustrating experience.  In fact, I often got discouraged and gave up.

				In addition, this was the first time I was living by myself, without the supervision of my parents.  Having been raised in an extremely traditional Chinese household, this newfound freedom was exhilarating.  All of a sudden, I finally got what I had wanted to do for years: make my own decisions without being nagged at.  Without my parents putting a check on what I do, I spent way too much time playing videogames, in particular League of Legends.  In fact, I actually skipped class sometimes so that I could game, and this definitely contributed to my lackluster grades.

				I had also entered college with the wrong mindset.  While working hard was not a foreign concept to me, I thought that I could retain my high school study habits and still earn straight A's.  If only I knew how wrong I was then!  Taking the beating that first semester of college threw at me was an extremely humbling experience, and I realized how close-minded I had been.  Being the top student in my high school didn't mean anything in college; this was an entirely new playing field.  Having the privilege to attend Cal means that I get to be surrounded by extremely brilliant people with whom I could have discourse with and learn from.  And though I was intimidated at first, I've realized that this is a community that will foster my growth.  I found myself several role models from just the people on my floor, and my desire to compete with them played a huge part in my shift in mindset second semester.

			<div class = "title">Second Semester: Redemption</div>
			<p class = "text">
				I was not happy with the grades that I had received first semester, and I made it my resolution to get as close to a 4.0 GPA as possible. Though the lack of sleep got to me from time to time, I can honestly say that I am extremely satisfied with the amount of effort and hard work I put into accomplishing this goal.  Faced with multiple nights where it felt impossible to complete a certain part of a project spec or understand some part of math, I'm proud to say that I stuck with my goals and did not give up, and that ultimately my efforts were rewarded.  Of course, I had known the importance of hard work and determination, but I pushed past my limits this semester and realized that my hidden self-doubts only served to chain my potential.  Of course, there were times where I felt smothered over the multitude of my assignments, but there's no room for giving up. At least, not for me.

			<div class = "title">Things That Worked for Me</div>
			<p class = "text">
				I learned more about myself this semester than any other period in my life.  Being confronted with a reality check within the first semester showed me that my old study habits would not cut it, and gave me enough time to figure out a better way to approach school.  I want to highlight the things that worked in helping me succeed academically second semester.  These things included doing homework with friends, making a daily to-do list, and keeping track of important deadlines on a whiteboard.  I also think that dual booting my computer with Ubuntu was also helpful, because I reserve the Ubuntu portion of my computer for school-this means it had no games.  By compartmentalizing my computer, I became more focused and my productivity definitely increased.
			<div class = "title">Personal Loss</div>
			<p class = "text">
				This year, I experienced losing one of my loved ones for the first time.  Around October, I ended a relationship that I had been in for three and a half years, and this was one of the darkest times I've ever experienced.  Having dated somebody for so long and then watching it fall apart was heartbreaking, especially since we had promised to make a long distance relationship work.  For the first time in a long while, I felt lost and alone.  It was hard to accept that things were over, and I lost motivation to do anything.  The most difficult part of this experience was watching everything slip away-my happiness, my grades, even my friends-and feeling indifferent towards everything.  However, things got so bad to the point where I realized that I needed to make a change.  I began to rethink my attitude towards life, and tried to do things that would help ease the pain.  But, I also accepted that my pain was justified and that I needed time to heal.  By the end of this whole ordeal, I realized the importance of self-love(cliche, I know) and came to terms with the fact that times change and sometimes you just have to let people out of your life.

				However, I don't look back on this relationship bitterly.  Things just weren't working out, and we had our fair share of happy moments and memories. However, I think I matured a lot throughout the course of this relationship, and I learned many things about compromise and mutual respect.  These are all important skills that I don't think I could have received anywhere else, and I am forever greatful for this relationship.

			<div class = "title">Making Friends</div>
			<p class = "text" >
				I'm very thankful for having chosen to live in the dorms, and especially with my roommate Brendon, whom I had met and roomed with at a summer program(COSMOS at UCSD) in 2014.  I was able to find myself a group of friends in the dorms who genuinely cared about me and provided a safe space to facilitate my healing process.  As I had mentioned before, they were also instrumental in motivating me to do better in academics.  I would see how hard they were working and I would be inspired to match, if not top, that.  Additionally, I made friends with people who were taking the same classes as me, and we would study together, which I found to be a more effective way of studying.  Without thinking consciously about it, I surrounded myself with people who were positive influences in my life, friends who challenged me to push my boundaries and caught me when I fell.  I guess that is one of the blessings of attending Cal; everyone is just so talented, hardworking, and supportive.

			<div class = "title">RCSA and Web Development Committee</div>
			<p class = "text">
				One of the major organizations that I was part of during freshman year was the Regents' and Chancellor's Scholarship Association (RCSA).  I think that I was drawn to it because it was an organization I was already part of when I entered school (all the scholarship recipients are automatically part of it), and I actually felt comfortable when I attended one of the welcoming events.  At the first general meeting, the various committees of RCSA gave presentations, and I was really interested in the web development one.  Though I didn't have any previous experience, the committee coordinators said that they would accept people of all backgrounds, and I gave it a shot.  I was fortunate enough to make it onto the committee, and it was there that I learned all the HTML and CSS I know.  Additionally, we were also taught how to use GitHub to manage the website, and by the end of first semester I was ready to contribute to the website.  Second semester, we were given a huge task of redesigning various pages on the RCSA website, and Elaine and I were assigned the scholarship page.  We pushed our final changes to the website around the middle of second semester, which you can view <a href = "http://rcsa.berkeley.edu/scholarship">here</a>.
			</p>
			<p class = "text">
				I'm really happy that I applied and got into the web development committee, because we became a very tight-knit group.  We basically became a family by the end of the year; in fact, we called our coordinators Andy and Jacqueline "dad" and "mom," respectively.  According to the leadership of RCSA, we seemed to have the strongest bond out of all the other committees, and this was reflected in our almost 100% attendance rate throughout the entire school year (typically attendance drops off second semester for other committees).  Through all our committee bonding exercises (sharing embarassing stories, getting boba together, etc.), I definitely have found a group of people who I feel comfortable with, and they made the transition into college a very smooth one.

			<div class = "title">Moving Forward and Plans for Next Year</div>
			<p class = "text">
				Despite all these positive changes I've made in my life, there are still things that I do not feel satisfied with yet.  In particular, I don't feel very involved with school organizations outside of RCSA, and part of this is because I justify skipping meetings by saying I have homework to do.  Next year, I am aiming to join at least one other club while staying active in RCSA and web development committee.  I also want to stray farther from my comfort zone and attend a career fair sometime during the year.  Additionally, I told myself at the beginning of the year that I would take care of my body, but when school got busy during the middle of second semester, I stopped going to the gym and exercising.  Next year, I am going to make the committment to exercise at least four times a week, no matter how busy I may be.  This year has been an incredible one full of growth, and I'm very optomistic about what the future holds.
