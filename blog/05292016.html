				It is often said that college is the most transformative period of your life, and freshman year definitely has lived up to that expectation.  Throughout the course of the year, I feel that I have learned and grown so much mentally, socially, and academically.  From days where school seemed hopeless to days that radiated happiness,  I've experienced a huge range of emotions, and this roller-coaster ride is something that I would not give for anything else in the world.

				Entering Berkeley, I had no knowledge of anything with regards to computer science; I had never taken a CS course and did not know what I wanted to major in yet.  However, I listened to my parents' suggestions to take a computer science course and decided to take CS61A. I regard this as one of the most definitive life-changing decisions, not only because I found something that genuinely interests me, but also because it has taught me many valuable life lessons that I will take forward from this experience.  Being my first computer science course, I encountered many obstacles throughout the semester that I had never faced before.  In high school, I understood most topics that I was presented with, and could usually figure things I didn't understand after a few hours of studying.  However, college, especially the ideas taught in CS61A, were extremely foreign to me and I could not apply these concepts in the homework.  As a result, I spent a lot more time than I had ever spent on homework, and it was just an extremely frustrating experience.  In fact, I often got discouraged and gave up.

				I had also entered college with the wrong mindset.  While working hard was not a foreign concept to me, I thought that I could retain my high school study habits and still earn straight A's.  If only I knew how wrong I was then!  Taking the beating that first semester of college threw at me was an extremely humbling experience, and I realized how close-minded I had been.  Being the top student in my high school didn't mean anything in college; this was an entirely new playing field.  Having the privilege to attend Cal means that I get to be surrounded by extremely brilliant people with whom I could have discourse with and learn from.  And though I was intimidated at first, I've realized that this is a community that will foster my growth.  I found myself several role models from just the people on my floor, and my desire to compete with them played a huge part in my shift in mindset second semester.

				I was not happy with the grades that I had received first semester, and I made it my resolution to get as close to a 4.0 GPA as possible. Though the lack of sleep got to me from time to time, I can honestly say that I am extremely satisfied with the amount of effort and hard work I put into accomplishing this goal.  Faced with multiple nights where it felt impossible to complete a certain part of a project spec or understand some part of math, I'm proud to say that I stuck with my goals and did not give up, and that ultimately my efforts were rewarded.  Of course, I had known the importance of hard work and determination, but I pushed past my limits this semester and realized that my hidden self-doubts only served to chain my potential.  Of course, there were periods of time where everything Moving forward, I plan on keeping this mindset and some things I intend to improve upon include minimizing the amount of time I spend to recover from finishing midterms/huge projects and staying focused for longer periods of time.

				This period of academic growth spanned the entire school year, but a large portion of my emotional growth occurred within the span of a few months.  Around October, I ended a relationship I had been in for three and a half years, and I fell into a deep bout of depression.  For the first time in a long while, I felt alone and insignificant.  It was hard to accept that things were over, and I lost motivation to do anything.  The most difficult part of this experience was watching everything slip away—my happiness, my grades, even my friends—and feeling indifferent towards everything.  However, things got so bad to the point where I was spurred to action, and that was what started the process of healing.  By the end of this whole ordeal, I realized the importance of self-love(cliche, I know) and came to terms with the fact that times change and sometimes you just have to let people out of your life.  Of course, my healing process with greatly aided by the presence and care of my friends.

				I'm very thankful for having chosen to live in the dorms, and especially with my roommate Brendon, whom I had met and roomed with at a summer program(COSMOS at UCSD) in 2014.  I was able to find myself a group of friends in the dorms who genuinely cared about me and provided a safe space to facilitate my healing process.  They were also instrumental in motivating me to do better in academics, simply because I would see how hard they were working and I would be inspired to match, if not top, that.  Additionally, being a member of the Regents' and Chancellors' Scholar Association(RCSA) web development committee has given me a network of amazing individuals to whom I can go to for advice and help.  Honestly, I'm just extremely happy with how this year turned out and I'm ready for what ever sophomore year has in store for me.

				I want to highlight the things that worked in helping me succeed academically this semester, things that I want to continue doing in the future.  These things include doing homework with friends, making a to-do list every day, and keeping track of important deadlines on Some things that worked in helping me succeed in school involved doing homework with friends, making a list of things to do per day, and keeping track of important deadlines.  I also think that dual booting my computer with Ubuntu was also helpful, because I reserve the Ubuntu portion of my computer for school—this means no games are downloaded onto it.  By compartmentalizing my computer, I am less likely to be distracted, and my producitivity has definitely increased.

				Despite all these positive changes I've made in my life, there are still things that I do not feel satisfied with yet.  In particular, I don't feel very involved with school organizations outside of RCSA, and part of this is because I justify skipping meetings by saying I have homework to do.  Next year, I am aiming to join at least one other club while staying active in RCSA and web development committee.  I also want to stray farther from my comfort zone and attend a career fair sometime during the year.  Additionally, I told myself at the beginning of the year that I would take care of my body, but when school got busy during the middle of second semester, I stopped going to the gym and exercising.  Next year, I am going to make the committment to exercise at least four times a week, no matter how busy I may be.  All in all, this year has been an incredible one full of growth and I'm very optomistic about what the future holds.
