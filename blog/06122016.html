      This past weekend, I participated in BaseHacks at the Microsoft Sunnyvale campus and it was a fairly fun experience.  Attending a hackathon has been on my bucket-list since I entered college, but I never went to one during the school year due to a myriad of reasons.  First of all, I didn't think I could handle spending 24 hours out of my week working on something that wasn't explicitly for school, because I was afraid that all my schoolwork would pile up and overwhelm me.  Additionally, I didn't have friends to go with and I would have felt awkward joining up with a team where I could potentially feel left out and alone.  Perhaps the biggest reason I didn't go to a hackathon was because I didn't think I was ready.  I didn't think I knew enough about coding to take an idea and turn it into a reality.  In retrospect, these reasons all sound like excuses in retrospect, but I think that they were valid points and I wanted my first hackathon experience to be one where I actually contribute towards the team.

        Taking and doing well in CS61B gave me the confidence boost I needed to step out of my comfort zone and try creating a project without the guidance of a provided spec.  I have to give credit to the huge text editor project—this project taught me a lot about writing a functioning application and how to debug.  It also proved that I knew enough about the fundamentals of computer science to take an idea and make it happen.  Throughout the course, I also made several friends with whom I studied with, and they were very open to the idea of attending a hackathon together.  In fact, they actually told me about BaseHacks.  Since school had finished, I had a lot of spare time so I drove up to BaseHacks and met with my group there.

        Coming up with a project was one of the harder parts of the hackathon.  We created a group chat a week prior to discuss ideas on Facebook, but it seemed like every proposition that we came up with had been done already.  Eventually, after about five days' worth of debating and discarding, we agreed on a design that was inspired by Waze, a community-based mapping application.  Waze is serves a similar purpose to Google Maps—the user inputs a destination and then Waze calculates the shortest path to it.  One of Waze's special features was that it also lists various gas stations along the way, and the user can filter by price.  What we decided to do was to create a similar application, but instead of displaying gas stations, we would display restaurants.

        Having come up with an idea, we arrived at the Microsoft Sunnyvale campus at 10:00 A.M. ready to work.  After checking in, we staked out a table for our group and started obtaining API keys from both Google Maps and Yelp.  We decided to go with a divide and conquer strategy—two of my teammates would work on the Google Maps part and I was tasked with figuring out the Yelp API with another one of my teammates (Emma).  After spending a bit of time looking at the documentation and examples, we decided to give it a try in Java.  However, the examples said we needed to log in to the server via the API key by importing a package.  I downloaded the package via sudo get-apt in terminal, but when I tried to compile my Java file, it said that the package did not exist.  After struggling with this for about two hours, we decided to give up and try doing it in Python, since we both had experience from CS61A.  Again, we had to download a separate package for authorization, but we still ran into errors running the file.  After struggling with this for another two hours, we gave up and decided to give PHP a try.  Neither of us had previous experience with this language, but we didn't have to import any modules/packages and after spending the hackathon on it, we got a script that was somewhat functional.  It could take in arguments from the command prompt and would output queries that matched the specific location that was passed in, but we didn't know how to integrate this with our other partners (who were writing the application in JavaScript).

        By the end of this experience, my teammates who were working on the Google Maps portion of it had a functional mapping application that provided the shortest route from one point to another.  It also found restaurants near any point along the route where the driver had to take a turn.  What my partner and I had finished was a script that used Yelp API to output restaurants that near a certain point, given their latitude and longitude positions.  The final part of this project was to integrate the two together, but we were completely lost in figuring out how to do that.  The idea we had was to take the latitude and longitude points at regular intervals along the route (we were thinking approximately every 5 miles or so) and passing that on to the PHP script and outputting the results on the map.  However, we ran out of time at the hackathon and we didn't submit anything.  However, we all agreed to finish this project, and we're planning on getting together over summer to complete it.

        Sharing a repository with three other people and working on the project forced me to deal with the multitude of problems that working with git/github can create, specifically, merge conflicts.  There were several times where someone pushed to the repository, and then someone else would try to push but they'd have to pull and there would be a merge conflict.  We even had to reset our repository because at one point, someone pushed a commit and then I pushed on top of it, deleting what they had previous written and putting my version onto Github.  I'm really happy that we encountered these kinds of problems during the hackathon because I feel like these would be issues that somebody working in industry might actually run into, and I'm proud that I was able to resolve them smoothly.

        Attending this hackathon has been an extremely eye-opening experience in terms of working with someone else's API and trying to figure out how to integrate different languages together.  Though we had worked out a plan to combine the two separate APIs together to make the final product, putting that plan into action was a lot harder than we expected and we were completely lost.  However, this experience was fun because this hackathon was basically a group project, but without the stress of doing well in a class.  I had a great time, and I'm looking forwards to attending more hackathons with friends.
