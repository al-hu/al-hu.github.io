				I started my journey teaching CS at the beginning of this year, when I became a lab assistant and a junior mentor for CSM as well.  Since then, I've learned a lot about teaching, and I've found that teaching is one of my passions.

			<p class = "text">
				I decided that volunteering as a lab assistant and junior mentor would be beneficial to me academically, since the best way to learn something is to teach it to somebody else.  By helping out with the weekly labs and holding weekly tutoring sessions, I would have to review and teach the material to people who were less familiar with it - which means that I had to be solid on the foundations.  In particular, since CS61A taught the core basics of computer science, I was given an opportunity to pick up where I had slacked off first semester.  In the end, it definitely helped me hone my understanding of the material, and my students also did really well in the class.

				When I decided to take summer classes at Berkeley, I decided to teach CSM and lab assist for CS61B as well.  It was during this period of time where I started to realize why teaching others computer science was so appealing to me.  Entering college, I had never coded in my life: not even in HTML.  So when I was instantly thrust into the whirlwind that is called CS61A, I struggled a lot.  As I was helping others understand the material in CS61B, I realized that there were so many other people who were in my shoes; they were trying to declare CS without any prior experience, and I can sympathize with that struggle.  I want to help them the same way I've been helped by others, and I guess that's why I really like teaching lower division computer science courses.

				However, teaching comes with its own set of difficulties: people sometimes don't show up or don't volunteer answers during discussion.  The most common of these issues is the the latter, and it's understandable; in an environment where everybody seems to be on top of their shit, one wants to fit in and avoid judgment for making a mistake.  I think that the most important part of teaching is to create a safe setting that gracefully accepts errors and fosters learning from ones' and others' mistakes.  Especially in a more intimate setting like the tiny mentoring sessions in CSM, students get more individual attention, so any misconceptions that they have can be cleared up.  But, the only way to know you have a misconception is to make the mistake, which is why having a safe space is important.
