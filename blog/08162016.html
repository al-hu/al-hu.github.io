				Instead of staying home this entire summer, I decided to stay in Berkeley and take my final prerequisite class in order to declare as a computer science major.  Most commonly referred to as the hardest lower division CS course, CS70 definitely lived up to that reputation.  In addition to the nature of summer courses being extremely fast paced, this class also covered pretty hard material and took up a lot of my time.  I also found an internship, which also took a large chunk of my time.  However, summer was an enjoyable experience because I took the class with some of my close friends and we got to spend quality time together.

			<p class = "text">
				Throughout the course of the school year, I realized that I made the correct choice in attending school away from home.  Don't get me wrong - I love my family but I didn't feel like I had the freedom to do whatever I want when I'm at home, since I don't have a car and my parents work long hours during the day.  I didn't want to have to burden them or my friends by asking for rides, so I basically stayed cooped up at home the entire time.  In fact, that's actually one of the reasons why I started making my own website.
			</p>
			<p class = "text">
				At college, I was afforded more freedom - my parents were no longer by my shoulder nagging me about things that I should do.  It was a welcome change from what I had experienced during high school, and I found I really enjoyed this feeling of independence; I was accountable for everything that I had to do.  Of course there were times where I forgot to do some things that my parents would have reminded me about, but it was a good feeling to just have a sense of autonomy.  It's funny because when I was in high school, I told myself that I wouldn't miss my parents or their constant attention, but I found myself missing their funny phrases and odd sense of humor.  And when spring semester ended, I found myself really looking forward to going home.
			</p>

				Going home was an interesting experience because a lot of things changed: the family dynamic, how my parents treated me, etc.  Thinking back on it, my sister was basically a single child for a year, and my parents treated her as such; they let her go over to friends' houses, actually listened to her suggestions for food, and took her out for boba.  These were things that they had never done for me when I was home, and it was just weird to witness.  When I arrived home, they were extremely happy to see me and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I had missed them.  In fact, they were so happy to see me that when they picked me up, we drove for an hour in the wrong direction and we had to drive two more hours to get home.  The most surprising part about this scenario was that my parents didn't even argue with each other!  At home, I got the impression that they tried their best to spend time with me despite having busy schedules and it was just a really nice to see this side of them.  My sister was also really excited to see me as well, and I found myself making more effort to spend time with her than normal.  I definitely feel that going to college helped strengthen the relationships within the entire family, and I'm extremely thankful for that.

				When I was home, I found myself scrolling various internship and job pages on Facebook, and eventually applied to some of them.  Much to my delight, I was offered a few interviews and after a couple of weeks, I got an internship at Berkeley that started right when summer classes started.  The job description was mainly front-end work; I was going to  help create a user interface for a web-based carbon trading game.  This stuck out to me because it combined two things that I liked/cared about: web design and climate change (specifically, raising awareness about it).  Additionally, I thought that it was something I could learn (PHP, mySQL, WordPress), and I started looking up tutorials on the various languages as soon as I was notified that I got the job.
			</p>
			<p class = "text">
				A lot of what I did involved user validation and collecting and managing form data and using it to write to a database and create dynamic pages based on user input, and I learned a lot about web development from working on this project.  To give a sense of how clueless I was prior to starting this internship, I didn't even know that there were two different methods of collecting form data!  Learning PHP wasn't too bad because its syntax is really similiar to that of Java's, except that there are different built-in functions, and I had some previous exposure to mySQL.  Overall, this was a good learning experience and in addition to learning more about web design, I also learned about the importance of a proper development workflow.
			</p>
			<p class = "text">
				This was actually the first time I was working on front-end development while querying/inserting into a database at the same time.  All the other projects that I have worked on so far - the RCSA website and my personal website - only had static pages.  We ended using WordPress because there were additional classes/objects that were already implemented, so we didn't have to reinvent the wheel, so to speak.  As with any CS project that I have done, I found myself testing my patience as I looked up documentation, specifically on WordPress actions and filters, and I also crashed the server more than a few times due to missing a parenthesis or colon here or there.  Overall though, I had a lot of fun working on this project over the summer, and I'm planning on continuing during the school year.

				This was actually a paid internship, and it's the first job that I've ever had.  It was an interesting experience to be making my own money for the first time; I stopped feeling as bad spending money on things such as food.  Throughout all of freshman year, when I did not have any source of income besides my parents, I was extremely frugal with everything; I would not go out for food and if I did, I'd buy the cheapest thing on the menu.  After taking this job though, I started to relax my grip on how I spent money and ended up treating myself once in a while (mainly with slightly higher quality food).  It's a good feeling to know that I'm finally pulling my own weight and not burdening my parents as much with financial needs and the money that I made this summer basically covered all the expenses I incurred this summer.  It just felt like I was finally starting to become a more self-sufficient adult, and I guess I feel more mature now.

			<p class = "text">
				Of course, I spent most of my time this summer focusing on school.  It was time for me to face the notorious CS70, and I actually needed a pretty high grade in this class in order to declare.  I think that this, compounded with the reputation that CS70 has, heightened the amount of stress I dealt with for the eight weeks during which summer school was in session.  The pace seemed blistering fast: we had six hours' worth of lecture and four hours' worth of discussion every week, in addition to weekly homework sets and optional homework parties (all of which I attended).  I ended up spending at least 15 hours on every homework assignment, and I'd normally study with friends until 9 or 10 at night on weekdays.  There were definitely many times where I thought about giving up because I didn't know how to think about a particular homework problem or could not grasp a concept, but giving up is never an option.  And I'm glad I didn't give up, because I learned a lot of material and new ways of thinking about concepts.  While I didn't necessarily enjoy the class while I was taking it, it was a good class to take and I learned a lot from it.

				I also decided that I wanted to help out with CS61B over the summer, and ended up lab assisting for two days a week, three hours each day.  It was a good experience in helping me remember what I had learned the previous semester, which is good because I am aiming to eventually become a GSI for the class.  Also, I really enjoyed CS61B and I kind of wanted to relive that experience, despite the fact that I didn't help out every day.  I also taught CSM over the summer for CS61B, and taking and teaching summer classes made me realize how it is a vastly different experience from taking the class during the school year.
			</p>
			<p class = "text">
				Over the summer, CS61B is taught as CS61BL, which means that it is a lab based class.  As a result, students have lab four days per week, in addition to daily lectures, homework, and projects, and each lab is three hours long.  It was insane, because the students had to instantly apply things that they learned about in lecture, and the material learned requires some amount of time to digest.  I feel like the same can be said about CS70 over summmer, and in general I think this is a trend among all summer classes.  Of course, this is because the curriculum normally takes about 14 weeks to teach and it's being condensed into 8 weeks, but there really isn't anything that can be done about it beside increasing the length of summer session.
			</p>
			<p class = "text">
				In hindsight, I don't think I want to take summer courses again, just because of the huge amount of stress that comes with it.  Oftentimes the material needs time to sink in, and when I was faced with a lot of material at once that I didn't understand the first time through, I found myself paralyzed and overwhelmed by what I did not know.  However, I do think that taking summer classes once was a good experience, and I definitely strengthened my study habits and work ethic.  While a super fast-paced course might work better for some people, I've learned that it is not something that works particularly well with me.

			<div class = "title">Friends at Berkeley</div>
			<p class = "text">
				A few of my friends (Natalia, Pearl, and Emma) stayed in Berkeley to take summer classes, and though we didn't all take the same class, we still studied and hung out together for a large portion of the time.  Usually we were downtown at Pearl's place until midnight, and then we would walk back to our homes on the northside of campus together.  During those walks, I got to know Emma and Natalia on a deeper level than I had before, and now I can confidently call Natalia, Pearl, and Emma my best friends.  There are some funny things that people do at midnight walking in Berkeley: bolting at the slightest noise is one of them.  Emma would instantly start running anytime she heard a rustle, or if I said a phrase after a period of silence.  We had many good laughs on the walk back home, and some of my favorite memories of college so far actually happened this summer.
			</p>
			<p class = "text">
				I also had a lot of fun exploring the nearby area with my friends.  During the first few weeks of summer session, we had a bit of free time on the weekends so we went out to San Francisco a few times and did a bunch of touristy things, such as walking across the Golden Gate Bridge together and climbing up the San Marin hill to look at the bay.  We also went to Union Square to get Boba Guys and tried some Asian-style restaurants in the area.  Another time, we went to Union City to get dim-sum together and we climbed up the Union City Pyramid, which was a really cool experience.  The Pyramid is basically a rope structure with a metallic frame that is about three stories high, and you can actually look down and see the floor.  And though I've had a fear of heights, I pushed myself to battle with that fear and I thoroughly enjoyed myself (despite shaking uncontrollably at the very top).

			<div class = "title">Learning to Cook</div>
			<p class = "text">
				In addition to exploring the area around Berkeley, we also ended up making food several times at Pearl's place.  Neither Pearl or I had much experience cooking, but Emma and Natalia did.  Together, we functioned as a mini family - Pearl and I would prepare the ingredients, Emma would oversee the actual cooking, and Natalia would handle roasting the vegetables.  Throughout the course of the summer, we cooked at least five meals (I lost count).  It was really fun and I think that making food together was a good bonding experience and definitely contributed to a feeling of family between all of us.

			<div class = "title">Onwards to Fall Semester!</div>
			<p class = "text">
				For next semester, I plan on continuing developing relationships that I have formed over the summer, as well as expanding my group of friends.  I want to be more active in more clubs and meet more people, and I'm going to try to regularly exercise as well.  I know I set this as my goal in my post at the end of the Spring 2016 semester, but I just want to refocus my vision for the upcoming semester.  Additionally, I plan on continuing to teach CSM and hopefully get the CS61B tutoring position that I applied for, so that I can apply to be a UGSI for CS61B in the next spring semester.  I have a much better understanding of my capabilities now and I really want to put myself out there, and hopefully all goes well.
