				Instead of staying home this entire summer, I decided to stay in Berkeley and take my final prerequisite class in order to declare as a computer science major.  Most commonly referred to as the hardest lower division CS course, CS70 definitely lived up to that reputation.  In addition to the nature of summer courses being extremely fast paced, this class also covered pretty hard material and took up a lot of my time.  However, summer was an enjoyable experience because I took the class with some of my close friends and we got to spend quality time together.

				Throughout the course of the school year, I realized that I made the correct choice in attending school away from home.  Don't get me wrong - I love my family but I didn't feel like I had the freedom to do whatever I want when I'm at home, since I don't have a car and my parents work long hours during the day.  I didn't want to have to burden them or my friends by asking for rides, so I basically stayed cooped up at home the entire time.  In fact, that's actually one of the reasons why I started making my own website.

				At college, I was afforded more freedom - my parents were no longer by my shoulder nagging me about things that I should do.  It was a welcome change from what I had experienced during high school, and I found I really enjoyed this feeling of independence; I was accountable for everything that I had to do.  Of course there were times where I forgot to do some things that my parents would have reminded me about, but it was a good feeling to just have a sense of autonomy.  It's funny because when I was in high school, I told myself that I wouldn't miss my parents or their constant attention, but I found myself missing their funny phrases and odd sense of humor.  And when spring semester ended, I found myself really looking forward to going home.

				Going home was an interesting experience because a lot of things changed: the family dynamic, how my parents treated me, etc.  Thinking back on it, my sister was basically a single child for a year, and my parents treated her as such; they let her go over to friends' houses, actually listened to her suggestions for food, and took her out for boba.  These were things that they had never done for me when I was home, and it was just weird to witness.  When I arrived home, they were extremely happy to see me and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I had missed them.  In fact, they were so happy to see me that when they picked me up, we drove for an hour in the wrong direction and we had to drive two more hours to get home.  The most surprising part about this scenario was that my parents didn't even argue with each other!  At home, I got the impression that they tried their best to spend time with me despite having busy schedules and it was just a really good feeling to see this side of them.  I definitely feel that going to college helped strengthen the relationships within the entire family.
