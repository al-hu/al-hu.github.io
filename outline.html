			Coming into Berkeley, I had previous coding experience--not even AP Computer Science in high school.  Throughout my first semester and all the struggles that learning computer science brought with it, I have grown to enjoy the journey in completing a project.  My favorite project was Ants vs. Some Bees (an insectified version of Plants vs. Zombies), in which we utilized object oriented programming to create different classes of ants to defend their hive against the invading bees.Coming into Berkeley, I had previous coding experience--not even AP Computer Science in high school.
