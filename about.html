		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p><pre>Hi!  My name is Albert and I'm going to be a second-year computer science major. Though I am extremely interested in technology, I have a deep appreciation for the humanities, which has been nurtured by the humanities magnet I attended for high school.  In particular, linguistics and how language relates to the human thought process--and by extension, how the human mind works--intrigue me the most.  As such, I am currently considering double majoring in cognitive science.
		
		Outside of schoolwork, I enjoy practicing piano, working out, and chilling with friends.  Coming from Los Angeles, there are still a lot of places in the Bay Area that I have not explored yet, so on the weekends, if I don't have any pressing responsibilities to take care of, I like to spend the day somewhere I haven't been to yet.</p>
