			<img class = "albert" src = "img/me.jpg" style="height: 269px; width: 400px; border-radius: 50%">
			<p class = "body-text">Hi, and welcome to my website!  My name is Albert and I am a second-year Regents' Scholar studying computer science at UC Berkeley.  Having lived in Los Angeles all my life, I decided that going to school far away from home would be a welcome change in my life, and it has been an incredibly rewarding experience.  I joined the Regents and Chancellors' Scholarship Association(RCSA)'s web development committee and participated in a tutoring group called <a class="undecorated-link" target="_blank" href="http://csmentors.berkeley.edu/">Computer Science Mentors</a> as a junior mentor.  Through these two organizations, I have found a community that is as passionate about computer science as I am.</p>
			<p class = "body-text">Outside of school, I can often be found at the piano bench, working out, or spending time with my friends.  If I have enough time on the weekends, I like to explore areas around Berkeley that I haven't been to yet.</p>

			<h1 class = "section-header">My Path (So Far)</h1>
			<p class = "body-text">Though mathematics and science have always been my strongest subjects, I decided to attend a <a class = "undecorated-link" target= "_blank" href="http://corebaby.org">humanities program</a> in high school with the intent to improve my writing skills.  I received that, and more.  Over the course of four years, I have been introduced to a multitude of varying viewpoints about the world--the most intriguing of which include the pivotal role of language in human thought.  This exposure has piqued my interest in understanding how the human mind works, and I want to work in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Additionally, this experience has pushed me to consider double majoring in cognitive science.</p>
