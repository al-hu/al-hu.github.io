<!-- “We are the sum total of our experiences. Those experiences – be they positive or negative – make us the person we are, at any given point in our lives. And, like a flowing river, those same experiences, and those yet to come, continue to influence and reshape the person we are, and the person we become. None of us are the same as we were yesterday, nor will be tomorrow.”

				It is often said that college is the most transformative period of your life, and freshman year has lived up to that expectation.  Throughout the course of the year, I feel that I have learned and grown so much mentally, socially, and academically.  From days where school seemed hopeless to days that radiated happiness,  I've experienced a huge range of emotions, and this roller-coaster ride is something that I would not give for anything else in the world.
			</p>
			<p class = "body-text hidden">
				Entering college, I had no knowledge of anything with regards to CS; I had never taken a CS course and did not have a definitive plan to major in it.  However, I decided to take an introduction to computer science course and this decision has to be one of my life-changing actions, not only because I found something that genuinely interests me, but also because it has taught me many valuable life lessons that I will take forward from this experience.  I started out expecting college to be as easy as high school had been for me, despite my parents' constant warnings not to hold that mindset.  As a result, my bad study habits from high school caused me to struggle through my courses throughout first semester.  After the first round of midterms, I realized that it was time to reevaluate how I learned, and I began to practice better goal-setting and self-control.  Following the initial panic, I regained control of my grades, though I was not 100% content with them.
			</p>
			<p class = "body-text hidden">
				Second semester, I made it my resolution to get as close to a 4.0 GPA as possible, and I can honestly say that I am extremely satisfied with the amount of effort and hard work I put into accomplishing this goal.  Faced with multiple nights where it felt impossible to complete a certain part of a project spec or understand some part of math, I'm proud to say that I stuck with my goals and did not give up, and that ultimately my efforts were rewarded.  Of course, I had known the importance of hard work and determination, but I pushed past my limits this semester and realized that my hidden self-doubts only served to chain my potential.  Moving forward, I plan on keeping this mindset and some things I intend to improve upon include minimizing the amount of time I spend to recover from finishing midterms/huge projects and staying focused for longer periods of time.
			</p>
			<p class = "body-text hidden">
				This period of academic growth spanned the entire school year, but a large portion of my emotional growth occurred within the span of a few months.  Around October, I ended a relationship I had been in for three and a half years, and I fell into a deep bout of depression.  For the first time in a long while, I felt alone and insignificant.  It was hard to accept that things were over, and I lost motivation to do anything.  The most difficult part of this experience was watching everything slip away—my happiness, my grades, even my friends—and feeling indifferent towards everything.  However, things got so bad to the point where I was spurred to action, and that was what started the process of healing.  By the end of this whole ordeal, I realized the importance of self-love(cliche, I know) and came to terms with the fact that times change and sometimes you just have to let people out of your life.  Of course, my healing process with greatly aided by the presence and care of my friends.
			</p>
			<p class = "body-text hidden">
				I'm very thankful for having chosen to live in the dorms, and especially with my roommate Brendon, whom I had met and roomed with at a summer program(COSMOS at UCSD) in 2014.  I was able to find myself a group of friends in the dorms who genuinely cared about me and provided a safe space to facilitate my healing process.  They were also instrumental in motivating me to do better in academics, simply because I would see how hard they were working and I would be inspired to match, if not top, that.  Additionally, being a member of the Regents' and Chancellors' Scholar Association(RCSA) web development committee has given me a network of amazing individuals to whom I can go to for advice and help.  Honestly, I'm just extremely happy with how this year turned out and I'm ready for what ever sophomore year has in store for me.
			</p>
			<p class = "body-text hidden">
				I want to highlight the things that worked in helping me succeed academically this semester, things that I want to continue doing in the future.  These things include doing homework with friends, making a to-do list every day, and keeping track of important deadlines on Some things that worked in helping me succeed in school involved doing homework with friends, making a list of things to do per day, and keeping track of important deadlines.  I also think that dual booting my computer with Ubuntu was also helpful, because I reserve the Ubuntu portion of my computer for school—this means no games are downloaded onto it.  By compartmentalizing my computer, I am less likely to be distracted, and my producitivity has definitely increased.
			</p>
			<p class = "body-text hidden">
				Despite all these positive changes I've made in my life, there are still things that I do not feel satisfied with yet.  In particular, I don't feel very involved with school organizations outside of RCSA, and part of this is because I justify skipping meetings by saying I have homework to do.  Next year, I am aiming to join at least one other club while staying active in RCSA and web development committee.  I also want to stray farther from my comfort zone and attend a career fair sometime during the year.  Additionally, I told myself at the beginning of the year that I would take care of my body, but when school got busy during the middle of second semester, I stopped going to the gym and exercising.  Next year, I am going to make the committment to exercise at least four times a week, no matter how busy I may be.  All in all, this year has been an incredible one full of growth and I'm very optomistic about what the future holds.

				This past weekend, I participated in BaseHacks at the Microsoft Sunnyvale campus and it was a fairly fun experience.  Attending a hackathon has been on my bucket-list since I entered college, but I never went to one during the school year due to a myriad of reasons.  First of all, I didn't think I could handle spending 24 hours out of my week working on something that wasn't explicitly for school, because I was afraid that all my schoolwork would pile up and overwhelm me.  Additionally, I didn't have friends to go with and I would have felt awkward joining up with a team where I could potentially feel left out and alone.  Perhaps the biggest reason I didn't go to a hackathon was because I didn't think I was ready.  I didn't think I knew enough about coding to take an idea and turn it into a reality.  In retrospect, these reasons all sound like excuses in retrospect, but I think that they were valid points and I wanted my first hackathon experience to be one where I actually contribute towards the team.

				Taking and doing well in CS61B gave me the confidence boost I needed to step out of my comfort zone and try creating a project without the guidance of a provided spec.  I have to give credit to the huge text editor project—this project taught me a lot about writing a functioning application and how to debug.  It also proved that I knew enough about the fundamentals of computer science to take an idea and make it happen.  Throughout the course, I also made several friends with whom I studied with, and they were very open to the idea of attending a hackathon together.  In fact, they actually told me about BaseHacks.  Since school had finished, I had a lot of spare time so I drove up to BaseHacks and met with my group there.
			</p>
			<p class = "body-text hidden">
				Coming up with a project was one of the harder parts of the hackathon.  We created a group chat a week prior to discuss ideas on Facebook, but it seemed like every proposition that we came up with had been done already.  Eventually, after about five days' worth of debating and discarding, we agreed on a design that was inspired by Waze, a community-based mapping application.  Waze is serves a similar purpose to Google Maps—the user inputs a destination and then Waze calculates the shortest path to it.  One of Waze's special features was that it also lists various gas stations along the way, and the user can filter by price.  What we decided to do was to create a similar application, but instead of displaying gas stations, we would display restaurants.
			</p>
			<p class = "body-text hidden">
				Having come up with an idea, we arrived at the Microsoft Sunnyvale campus at 10:00 A.M. ready to work.  After checking in, we staked out a table for our group and started obtaining API keys from both Google Maps and Yelp.  We decided to go with a divide and conquer strategy—two of my teammates would work on the Google Maps part and I was tasked with figuring out the Yelp API with another one of my teammates (Emma).  After spending a bit of time looking at the documentation and examples, we decided to give it a try in Java.  However, the examples said we needed to log in to the server via the API key by importing a package.  I downloaded the package via sudo get-apt in terminal, but when I tried to compile my Java file, it said that the package did not exist.  After struggling with this for about two hours, we decided to give up and try doing it in Python, since we both had experience from CS61A.  Again, we had to download a separate package for authorization, but we still ran into errors running the file.  After struggling with this for another two hours, we gave up and decided to give PHP a try.  Neither of us had previous experience with this language, but we didn't have to import any modules/packages and after spending the hackathon on it, we got a script that was somewhat functional.  It could take in arguments from the command prompt and would output queries that matched the specific location that was passed in, but we didn't know how to integrate this with our other partners (who were writing the application in JavaScript).
			</p>
			<p class = "body-text hidden">
				By the end of this experience, my teammates who were working on the Google Maps portion of it had a functional mapping application that provided the shortest route from one point to another.  It also found restaurants near any point along the route where the driver had to take a turn.  What my partner and I had finished was a script that used Yelp API to output restaurants that near a certain point, given their latitude and longitude positions.  The final part of this project was to integrate the two together, but we were completely lost in figuring out how to do that.  The idea we had was to take the latitude and longitude points at regular intervals along the route (we were thinking approximately every 5 miles or so) and passing that on to the PHP script and outputting the results on the map.  However, we ran out of time at the hackathon and we didn't submit anything.  However, we all agreed to finish this project, and we're planning on getting together over summer to complete it.
			</p>
			<p class = "body-text hidden">
				Attending this hackathon has been an extremely eye-opening experience in terms of working with someone else's API and trying to figure out how to integrate different languages together.  Though we had worked out a plan to combine the two separate APIs together to make the final product, putting that plan into action was a lot harder than we expected and we were completely lost.  However, this experience was fun because this hackathon was basically a group project, but without the stress of doing well in a class.  I had a great time, and I'm looking forwards to attending more hackathons with friends.
