<!-- “We are the sum total of our experiences. Those experiences – be they positive or negative – make us the person we are, at any given point in our lives. And, like a flowing river, those same experiences, and those yet to come, continue to influence and reshape the person we are, and the person we become. None of us are the same as we were yesterday, nor will be tomorrow.”

				It is often said that college is the most transformative period of your life, and freshman year has lived up to that expectation.  Throughout the course of the year, I feel that I have learned and grown so much mentally, socially, and academically.  From days where school seemed hopeless to days that radiated happiness,  I've experienced a huge range of emotions, and this roller-coaster ride is something that I would not give for anything else in the world.

				Entering college, I had no knowledge of anything with regards to CS; I had never taken a CS course and did not have a definitive plan to major in it.  However, I decided to take an introduction to computer science course and this decision has to be one of my life-changing actions, not only because I found something that genuinely interests me, but also because it has taught me many valuable life lessons that I will take forward from this experience.  I started out expecting college to be as easy as high school had been for me, despite my parents' constant warnings not to hold that mindset.  As a result, my bad study habits from high school caused me to struggle through my courses throughout first semester.  After the first round of midterms, I realized that it was time to reevaluate how I learned, and I began to practice better goal-setting and self-control.  Following the initial panic, I regained control of my grades, though I was not 100% content with them.

				Second semester, I made it my resolution to get as close to a 4.0 GPA as possible, and I can honestly say that I am extremely satisfied with the amount of effort and hard work I put into accomplishing this goal.  Faced with multiple nights where it felt impossible to complete a certain part of a project spec or understand some part of math, I'm proud to say that I stuck with my goals and did not give up, and that ultimately my efforts were rewarded.  Of course, I had known the importance of hard work and determination, but I pushed past my limits this semester and realized that my hidden self-doubts only served to chain my potential.  Moving forward, I plan on keeping this mindset and some things I intend to improve upon include minimizing the amount of time I spend to recover from finishing midterms/huge projects and staying focused for longer periods of time.

				This period of academic growth spanned the entire school year, but a large portion of my emotional growth occurred within the span of a few months.  Around October, I ended a relationship I had been in for three and a half years, and I fell into a deep bout of depression.  For the first time in a long while, I felt alone and insignificant.  It was hard to accept that things were over, and I lost motivation to do anything.  The most difficult part of this experience was watching everything slip away—my happiness, my grades, even my friends—and feeling indifferent towards everything.  However, things got so bad to the point where I was spurred to action, and that was what started the process of healing.  By the end of this whole ordeal, I realized the importance of self-love(cliché, I know) and came to terms with the fact that times change and sometimes you just have to let people out of your life.  Of course, my healing process with greatly aided by the presence and care of my friends.

				I'm very thankful for having chosen to live in the dorms, and especially with my roommate Brendon, whom I had met and roomed with at a summer program(COSMOS at UCSD) in 2014.  I was able to find myself a group of friends in the dorms who genuinely cared about me and provided a safe space to facilitate my healing process.  They were also instrumental in motivating me to do better in academics, simply because I would see how hard they were working and I would be inspired to match, if not top, that.  Additionally, being a member of the Regents' and Chancellors' Scholar Association(RCSA) web development committee has given me a network of amazing individuals to whom I can go to for advice and help.  Honestly, I'm just extremely happy with the friends I made this year, and I'm very optimistic about what the future holds.

				Despite all these positive changes I've made in my life, there are still things that I do not feel satisfied with yet.  In particular, I don't feel very involved with school organizations outside of RCSA, and part of this is because I justify skipping meetings by saying I have homework to do.  Next year, I am aiming to join at least one other club while staying active in RCSA and web development committee.  Additionally, I want to stray farther from my comfort zone and attend a career fair sometime during the year.

				I want to highlight the things that worked in helping me succeed academically this semester, things that I want to continue doing in the future.  These things include doing homework with friends, making a to-do list every day, and keeping track of important deadlines on Some things that worked in helping me succeed in school involved doing homework with friends, making a list of things to do per day, and keeping track of important deadlines.  I also think that dual booting my computer with Ubuntu was also helpful, because I reserve the Ubuntu portion of my computer for school—this means no games downloaded onto it.  This way, if I feel the urge to play videogames, I would need to shut off my computer and run the Windows boot, but then I realize that gaming is not worth the time my computer takes to restart.
