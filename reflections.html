<!-- “We are the sum total of our experiences. Those experiences – be they positive or negative – make us the person we are, at any given point in our lives. And, like a flowing river, those same experiences, and those yet to come, continue to influence and reshape the person we are, and the person we become. None of us are the same as we were yesterday, nor will be tomorrow.”

				It is often said that college is the most transformative period of your life, and freshman year has lived up to that expectation.  Throughout the course of the year, I feel that I have learned and grown so much mentally, socially, and academically.  From days where school seemed hopeless to days that radiated happiness,  I've experienced a huge range of emotions, and this roller-coaster ride is something that I would not give for anything else in the world.
			</p>
			<p class = "body-text hidden">
				Entering college, I had no knowledge of anything with regards to CS; I had never taken a CS course and did not have a definitive plan to major in it.  However, I decided to take an introduction to computer science course and this decision has to be one of my life-changing actions, not only because I found something that genuinely interests me, but also because it has taught me many valuable life lessons that I will take forward from this experience.  I started out expecting college to be as easy as high school had been for me, despite my parents' constant warnings not to hold that mindset.  As a result, my bad study habits from high school caused me to struggle through my courses throughout first semester.  After the first round of midterms, I realized that it was time to reevaluate how I learned, and I began to practice better goal-setting and self-control.  Following the initial panic, I regained control of my grades, though I was not 100% content with them.
			</p>
			<p class = "body-text hidden">
				Second semester, I made it my resolution to get as close to a 4.0 GPA as possible, and I can honestly say that I am extremely satisfied with the amount of effort and hard work I put into accomplishing this goal.  Faced with multiple nights where it felt impossible to complete a certain part of a project spec or understand some part of math, I'm proud to say that I stuck with my goals and did not give up, and that ultimately my efforts were rewarded.  Of course, I had known the importance of hard work and determination, but I pushed past my limits this semester and realized that my hidden self-doubts only served to chain my potential.  Moving forward, I plan on keeping this mindset and some things I intend to improve upon include minimizing the amount of time I spend to recover from finishing midterms/huge projects and staying focused for longer periods of time.

				This period of academic growth spanned the entire school year, but a large portion of my emotional growth occurred within the span of a few months.  Around October, I ended a relationship I had been in for three and a half years, and I fell into a deep bout of depression.  For the first time in a long while, I felt alone and insignificant.  It was hard to accept that things were over, and I lost motivation to do anything.  The most difficult part of this experience was watching everything slip away—my happiness, my grades, even my friends—and feeling indifferent towards everything.  However, things got so bad to the point where I was spurred to action, and that was what started the process of healing.  By the end of this whole ordeal, I realized the importance of self-love(cliche, I know) and came to terms with the fact that times change and sometimes you just have to let people out of your life.  Of course, my healing process with greatly aided by the presence and care of my friends.
			</p>

				I'm very thankful for having chosen to live in the dorms, and especially with my roommate Brendon, whom I had met and roomed with at a summer program(COSMOS at UCSD) in 2014.  I was able to find myself a group of friends in the dorms who genuinely cared about me and provided a safe space to facilitate my healing process.  They were also instrumental in motivating me to do better in academics, simply because I would see how hard they were working and I would be inspired to match, if not top, that.  Additionally, being a member of the Regents' and Chancellors' Scholar Association(RCSA) web development committee has given me a network of amazing individuals to whom I can go to for advice and help.  Honestly, I'm just extremely happy with how this year turned out and I'm ready for what ever sophomore year has in store for me.
			</p>
			<p class = "body-text hidden">
				I want to highlight the things that worked in helping me succeed academically this semester, things that I want to continue doing in the future.  These things include doing homework with friends, making a to-do list every day, and keeping track of important deadlines on Some things that worked in helping me succeed in school involved doing homework with friends, making a list of things to do per day, and keeping track of important deadlines.  I also think that dual booting my computer with Ubuntu was also helpful, because I reserve the Ubuntu portion of my computer for school—this means no games are downloaded onto it.  By compartmentalizing my computer, I am less likely to be distracted, and my producitivity has definitely increased.
			</p>
			<p class = "body-text hidden">
				Despite all these positive changes I've made in my life, there are still things that I do not feel satisfied with yet.  In particular, I don't feel very involved with school organizations outside of RCSA, and part of this is because I justify skipping meetings by saying I have homework to do.  Next year, I am aiming to join at least one other club while staying active in RCSA and web development committee.  I also want to stray farther from my comfort zone and attend a career fair sometime during the year.  Additionally, I told myself at the beginning of the year that I would take care of my body, but when school got busy during the middle of second semester, I stopped going to the gym and exercising.  Next year, I am going to make the committment to exercise at least four times a week, no matter how busy I may be.  All in all, this year has been an incredible one full of growth and I'm very optomistic about what the future holds.

				I participated in BaseHacks this past weekend, and I had a great time.  Attending a hackathon has been on my bucketlist since the beginning of freshman year, but I never had time for a 24-hour event during the school year.  In addition, I didn't think I knew enough about coding to face the challenge of creating an application/project on my own, and that if I joined a random team, I would just be dead weight.  I had heard about this particular hackathon through Emma, one of my friends that I got to know through CS61B, and we went together with two of her friends.  It took place at the Sunnyvale Microsoft campus, and it was cool because we actually did this in one of their main buildings.  Our idea for the hackathon was a mix between Google Maps and Yelp--a user would choose a destination to go to, and along the route, we would find restaurants that match the user's price range within a certain distance from the route they decided to take.  In doing so, we decided that we would need to use GoogleMaps and Yelp API.
				TThis past weekend, I participated in BaseHacks at the Microsoft Sunnyvale campus and it was a fairly fun experience.  Attending a hackathon has been on my bucket-list since I entered college, but I never went to one during the school year due to a myriad of reasons.  First of all, I didn't think I could handle spending 24 hours out of my week working on something that wasn't explicitly for school, because I was afraid that all my schoolwork would pile up and overwhelm me.  Additionally, I didn't have friends to go with and I would have felt awkward joining up with a team where I could potentially feel left out and alone.  Perhaps the biggest reason I didn't go to a hackathon was because I didn't think I was ready.  I didn't think I knew enough about coding to take an idea and turn it into a reality.  In retrospect, these reasons all sound like excuses in retrospect, but I think that they were valid points and I wanted my first hackathon experience to be one where I actually contribute towards the team.

Taking and doing well in CS61B gave me the confidence boost I needed to step out of my comfort zone and try creating a project without the guidance of a provided spec.  I have to give credit to the huge text editor project—this project taught me a lot about writing a functioning application and how to debug.  It also proved that I knew enough about the fundamentals of computer science to take an idea and make it happen.  Additionally, throughout the course, I made several friends with whom I studied with, and they actually told me about this hackahton.  Since school had ended, I could afford to spend time away from home, and the previous barriers that had prevented me from attending a hackathon were no longer there.  I had found myself a group of friends that I knew and trusted, who I could rely on to pull their weight in the project.
