				CS61A was the first computer science class I ever took, and it was an extremely humbling experience for me.  Throughout most of highschool, I breezed through all my classes, earning perfect grades without having to spend much time on my studies.  However, I got a huge reality check when I scored 42.5% on the first midterm--about 15% below the average.  This was the first time I had ever scored below a B on a test, and I realized that my high school study habits weren't going to cut it.  I completely changed the way I approached school and eventually did fairly well the class.  Looking back on the experience, I'm extremely thankful because it has enabled me to grow personally and academically.

				This class is the first in the CS61 series, which are prerequisites to declaring the Computer Science major in the College of Letters and Sciences.  Throughout the entire semester, I was introduced to topics that I had never heard of before, such as recursion, environment diagrams, and object oriented programming, to name a few.  I really liked object-oriented programming, which is why the <a class = "undecorated-link" href = "http://cs61a.org/proj/ants/">Ants vs. Some Bees</a> (Plants vs. Zombies, but insects) project was my favorite.

				<!-- Coming into Berkeley, I had previous coding experience--not even AP Computer Science in high school.  Throughout my first semester and all the struggles that learning computer science brought with it, I have grown to enjoy the journey in completing a project.  My favorite project was Ants vs. Some Bees (an insectified version of Plants vs. Zombies), in which we utilized object oriented programming to create different classes of ants to defend their hive against the invading bees. -->

				So far, this has been my favorite computer science class at Cal, for a multitude of reasons.  Though the material was challenging and there was a lot of information to absorb, it was easier to comprehend; I attribute this to the fact that I had a stronger grasp of CS fundamentals that I did first semester.  Additionally, the various topics that the class touched upon--data structures, graphs, sorting algorithms, and runtimes--were all very interesting topics for me.  In particular, I was rather awed by the concept of a <a class = "undecorated-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure">disjoint set</a>, because the optimized implementation used a simple data structure--an int array--in such an ingenius way.  Additionally, I thorougly enjoyed learning about the various sorting algorithms--especially mergesort and quicksort.  It was also amusing to watch the visual representations of all the sorts in action, which you can view <a class = "undecorated-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg">here</a>.
				<!-- So far, this has been my favorite computer science class at Cal, maybe because I did well in it, or maybe because I had a stronger understanding of CS than first semester.  Either way, I resolved to meet the challenges that CS61B presented head-on.  Through creating a text editor from scratch to learning the pros and cons of various data structures, I learned a lot from this experience.  The text editor was my first taste of writing a huge program, and it opened my eyes to the complexity of a simple text editor like Notepad.  My favorite project of the semester was BearMaps, in which we built a miniature version of Google Maps for the Berkeley area, simply because it was the culminating project that put to use our knowledge of data structures, and it had an extremely cool, real-life application. -->

				Of course, this class had its fair share of projects, and these projects were valuable learning experiences (though they were also the cause of a huge amount of stress).  The two main projects of CS61B were creating a <a class ="undecorated-link" href="http://cs61b.ug/sp16/materials/proj/proj2/proj2.html">text editor</a> from scratch using JavaFX and creating a miniature version of Google Maps for the Berkeley area, called <a class="undecorated-link" href="http://cs61b.ug/sp16/materials/proj/proj3/proj3.html">BearMaps</a>.

				The text editor project was the first large-scale project that I had ever worked on, with the end result consisting of over 1000 lines of code.  We designed the API on our own from scratch, and I learned firsthand the importance of modularization (and what can happen if you don't modularize).  After having struggled for hours with this project, I have a new-found appreciation for simple text editors, such as Notepad.

				BearMaps was my favorite because it was the culminating project of the class, and it put to use what I had learned in the class about data structures.  Additionally, I got hands-on experience working with an existing code base and implementing back-end work for a web application.  I also learned to parse and work with data provided from an online source.
