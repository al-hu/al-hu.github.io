		<h3 class = "section" id = "CS61A"> CS61A </h3>
		<p> Coming into Berkeley, I had previous coding experience--not even AP Computer Science in high school.  Throughout my first semester and all the struggles that learning computer science brought with it, I have grown to enjoy the journey in completing a project.</p>

		<h3 class = "section" id = "CS61B"> CS61B </h3>
		<p id = "CS61B"> So far, this has been my favorite computer science class at Cal, maybe because I did well in it, or maybe because I had a stronger understanding of CS than first semester.  Either way, I resolved to meet the challenges that CS61B presented head-on.  Through creating a text editor from scratch to building a miniature version of Google Maps (called BearMaps) for the Berkeley area, I learned a lot from this experience.  The text editor was my first taste of writing a huge program, and it opened my eyes to the complexity of a simple text editor like Notepad.  BearMaps was my favorite project of the semester, simply because it was the culminating project that put to use our knowledge of data structures, and it had an extremely cool, real-life application.</p>
