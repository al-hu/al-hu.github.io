			<p> Coming into Berkeley, I had previous coding experience--not even AP Computer Science in high school.  Throughout my first semester and all the struggles that learning computer science brought with it, I have grown to enjoy the journey in completing a project.  My favorite project was Ants vs. Some Bees (an insectified version of Plants vs. Zombies), in which we utilized object oriented programming to create different classes of ants to defend their hive against the invading bees.</p>

			<h3 class = "section" id = "CS61B"> CS61B </h3>
			<p id = "CS61B"> So far, this has been my favorite computer science class at Cal, maybe because I did well in it, or maybe because I had a stronger understanding of CS than first semester.  Either way, I resolved to meet the challenges that CS61B presented head-on.  Through creating a text editor from scratch to learning the pros and cons of various data structures, I learned a lot from this experience.  The text editor was my first taste of writing a huge program, and it opened my eyes to the complexity of a simple text editor like Notepad.  My favorite project of the semester was BearMaps, in which we built a miniature version of Google Maps for the Berkeley area, simply because it was the culminating project that put to use our knowledge of data structures, and it had an extremely cool, real-life application.</p>
